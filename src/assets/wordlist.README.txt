About wordlist.txt

wordlist.txt provides the built-in collection of words PasswordGen uses when making passwords.

This word list file was generated using SCOWL (Spell Checker Oriented Word Lists)
<http://wordlist.aspell.net/>, which is derived from many sources under a BSD compatible license.
The combined work is freely available under a MIT-like license
<https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kevina/wordlist/master/scowl/Copyright>.


Generate as follows:

* Checkout and `make` code from https://github.com/en-wl/wordlist.git

* Run, stripping accents, removing "'s" suffixes and upper/lower case duplicates:
    ./mk-list --accents strip british 10 | grep -v "'" | sort -u | uniq -i > wordlist_full.txt

* Remove words shorter than three letters:
    awk '{ if (length($0) > 2) print }' wordlist_full.txt > wordlist.txt

* Copy wordlist.txt to the src/assets directory.

PasswordGen must be re-built (e.g. `cargo build`) to use the new word list.
